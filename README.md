# table-from-CSV-file
Create an Interactive Table from CSV file

This is a simple script to allow a user to upload a CSV file and generate a blank table. The user can then drag-and-drop the correct terms into the table to replicate the original table - this is helpful for self-learning for those who like to fill in tables with information. The terms are scrambled to ensure the user must remember the file order. The original table is shown above the interactive table for easy review if unable to supply answer from memory.
